---  

This project was developed for the **Advanced Computer Vision Methods** course at the University of Ljubljana. It implements and compares two classical optical flow estimation methods—**Lucas-Kanade** and **Horn-Schunck**—with evaluations on synthetic and real-world image sequences. Key analyses include parameter sensitivity, runtime optimization, and confidence-based reliability assessment using the Harris response.  

The repository includes:  
- `other/`:  Contains image sequences used for experiments.
- `ex1_utils.py`: Utility functions for data loading, visualization, and metric computation.  
- `of_methods.py`: Core implementations of **Lucas-Kanade** and **Horn-Schunck** methods.  
- `run_vaja_1.py`: Main script to execute experiments and generate results.  
- `Report-1.pdf`: Detailed report covering methodology, parameter analysis, results, and conclusions.
